***Inspection Data Analysis***
The data pertains to the inspection of various restaurants across diverse regions globally. In this project, data standardization has been implemented utilizing Power Query, and various DAX functions have been employed to create measures. Additionally, a report has been generated using dashboards that illustrate different facets of the analysis and offer valuable insights.

***OVERVIEW***
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of restaurant inspections, focusing on inspection volume, sanitation grades, and violations. Key metrics include the total number of inspections, average sanitation grade, and the number of violations.

**Key Findings**
*Inspection Volume:*

*Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley have the highest inspection volumes, suggesting a greater emphasis on oversight in these areas.
*Other regions, such as Northeast L.A. and Angeles Forest, have significantly lower inspection volumes.


*Sanitation Grades:*

*The average sanitation grade is 92.21, indicating a generally high level of compliance.
However, the goal of 92 is not quite met, suggesting room for improvement.


*Violations:*

*The most common violations are related to floors, walls, and ceilings, indicating a need for better maintenance and cleaning practices.
*Other common violations involve non-food-contact surfaces, equipment, and plumbing.


*Regional Variations:*

*Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley have the highest number of violations, which might be attributed to their higher inspection volumes.
*Westside has a relatively low number of violations.

*Geographic Distribution*

The map clearly illustrates the concentration of restaurants in specific regions, particularly Los Angeles, San Gabriel Valley, and the San Fernando Valley.
This suggests that these areas may require increased oversight and resources to ensure compliance with sanitation standards.
*Sanitation Grades*

The pie chart shows that the majority of restaurants (85.59%) have a sanitation grade of "OK," indicating a generally good level of compliance.
However, a significant portion (13%) have minor violations, while a small percentage (1.41%) have serious violations.
*Trending Violations:*

The bar chart reveals a relatively stable trend in the number of violations over the past year.
