***Inspection Data Analysis***
The data pertains to the inspection of various restaurants across diverse regions globally. In this project, data standardization has been implemented utilizing Power Query, and various DAX functions have been employed to create measures. Additionally, a report has been generated using dashboards that illustrate different facets of the analysis and offer valuable insights.

***OVERVIEW***
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of restaurant inspections, focusing on inspection volume, sanitation grades, and violations. Key metrics include the total number of inspections, average sanitation grade, and the number of violations.

**Key Findings**
Inspection Volume:

Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley have the highest inspection volumes, suggesting a greater emphasis on oversight in these areas.
Other regions, such as Northeast L.A. and Angeles Forest, have significantly lower inspection volumes.
Sanitation Grades:

The average sanitation grade is 92.21, indicating a generally high level of compliance.
However, the goal of 92 is not quite met, suggesting room for improvement.
Violations:

The most common violations are related to floors, walls, and ceilings, indicating a need for better maintenance and cleaning practices.
Other common violations involve non-food-contact surfaces, equipment, and plumbing.


Regional Variations:

Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley have the highest number of violations, which might be attributed to their higher inspection volumes.
Westside has a relatively low number of violations.

*Violation Analysis*
Violations by Region and Type: Displays the number of violations categorized by region and type.
Drill-down Functionality: The dashboard might allow users to drill down into specific regions or violation types for more detailed information.
Visualization: A treemap or sunburst chart could be used to visualize the hierarchy of regions and violation types.

*Trend Analysis*
Violations Trending: Potentially shows a trend of violations over time, helping identify patterns or changes.

*Geographic Analysis*
Restaurant Zip Code and Sanitation Grade: Displays the distribution of sanitation grades across different zip codes.
Visualization: A map with color-coded markers or heatmap could be used to visualize the geographic distribution of sanitation grades.
Other Potential Functionalities
Filtering and Sorting:Data can be filtered by region, county, or other criteria, and sorted by different metrics.
